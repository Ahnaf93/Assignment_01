//My song list//

 Functionality :

The main functionality of this site is basically to store the name of the song given (inputed) by the user. 

* For this purpose, the user must have to give input for the name of the song which he/she had already listened or going to listen soon. 

* After inserting the name and pressing the save song button, the system will store the name into its local storage and the name will be appeared on the list (My song list) given below. 

* If the user wants to remove the song from the list (My song list), he/she must have to click on to the CROSS SIGN (red color) which will eventually delete the name of the entered song from the local storage.
